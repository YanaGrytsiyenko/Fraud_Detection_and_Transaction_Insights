# Fraud Detection & Transaction Insights

## Project Description

This project is aimed at analyzing fraudulent transactions and gaining insights into transactions and the system that detects them. Using Python and Tableau, I processed data for analysis and visualization, which allows identifying key aspects and anomalies.

The project contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- **`UKR_Fraud_Detection_&_Transaction_Insights.ipynb`**: The Ukrainian version of the project that includes the entire process of analyzing fraudulent transactions.
- **`ENG_Fraud_Detection_&_Transaction_Insights.ipynb`**: The English version of the project for an international audience with the same analysis process.

The project also includes an interactive **[Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project_17417206273100/FraudDetectionTransactionInsights?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**, available on the Tableau Public platform, where you can visualize key metrics and analysis results.

## Data Overview

**Source**: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset/data)  
**Size**: 6,362,620 rows and 11 columns.

### Key Fields:
- **`step`**: a unit of time, where 1 step equals 1 hour.
- **`type`**: the type of online transaction.
- **`amount`**: the transaction amount.
- **`nameOrig`**: the client who initiates the transaction.
- **`oldbalanceOrg`**: balance before the transaction.
- **`newbalanceOrig`**: balance after the transaction.
- **`nameDest`**: the recipient of the transaction.
- **`oldbalanceDest`**: the initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
- **`newbalanceDest`**: the new balance of the recipient after the transaction.
- **`isFraud`**: fraudulent transaction.
- **`isFlaggedFraud`**: system flag marking this as a fraudulent transaction.

**Last data update**: 2022.  
**Data downloaded**: The data was downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AhnMI7DsFwXGb3aisYj1p7DVExXEB_0x/view?usp=sharing). 

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For additional data transformations and visualizations.
  - Data manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations and dashboards.

- **Google Colab**: For writing and executing Python scripts.

- **GitHub**: Repository for the project code and documentation.

## Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removal of missing values.
   - Conversion of categorical variables to numerical.

2. **Analysis**: 
   - Formulating questions for analysis and searching for answers.

3. **Visualization**: 
   - Creating plots using Python.
   - Building an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Key Findings

ðŸ“Œ The system likely has a limited threshold for marking suspicious transactions (around 5 million UAH), so fraudsters may split large amounts into smaller payments to avoid detection.

ðŸ“Œ The system detects only 0.19% of fraudulent transactions, indicating a need for model improvement.

ðŸ“Œ More attention is needed for **CASH_OUT** and **TRANSFER** transactions, as they are the most commonly used by fraudsters.

ðŸ“Œ It is important to monitor clients who were previously detected as fraudsters, as they might perform further transactions that the system no longer detects.

ðŸ“Œ It is recommended to add new columns to the data, such as:
   - Transaction dates.
   - Countries or regions.
   - Bank information.
   - Transaction duration and other relevant data.
